This bot is designed to automatically click on a specified color within a defined area on the screen, streamlining repetitive actions where color-based targeting is essential. With a simple GUI for selecting colors, setting search areas, and adjusting click delay, users can easily configure the bot to suit various tasks.

### Features
- **Color Selection**: Choose any pixel color by hovering and pressing the "Set Color" button.
- **Area Selection**: Drag to create a search area, focusing the botâ€™s actions on a specific screen region.
- **Auto-Clicking**: Automatically clicks on the first instance of the selected color detected within the area.
- **Loop Delay Adjustment**: Customize the interval between clicks for optimal performance.
- **Hotkey Controls**: Start/stop the bot with `Ctrl+S`, toggle clicking with `Ctrl+Space`, and select color with `F`.

Built with PyAutoGUI, OpenCV, and Tkinter, this program is ideal for automating interactions in environments where specific color elements require consistent attention.
